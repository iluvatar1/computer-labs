* Cloning a device into an image
  Based on Clonezilla live (not the server)
  - When booting, choose alternative modes to have better resolution.
  - Choose the language
  - Start clonezilla
  - select device-image
  - To save, use local_dev (or the appropriate)
  - Select the parent dir where to save the image
  - choose beginner
  - Use savedisk to save local disk to image
  - use the default name or modify it
  - choose the disk to clone
  - skip checking (but better check if you are getting errors when
    creating the image)
  - select check the saved image
  - Do not encrypt
  - choose reboot if you want
  DONE

  Also it can be done with the following procedure:
  1. Open up a terminal
  2. Mount the target device, where you want to save the image, into
     =/home/partimage=
  3. Run the following command:
     #+begin_src shell
/usr/sbin/ocs-sr -q2 -c -j2 -z1p -i 4096 -fsck-y -senc -p choose savedisk IMAGENAME sda
     #+end_src

* Cloning an image to several computers using clonezilla server
** Drbl server
- Burn drbl-server live on a usb
- Boot the computer-server from the usb
- Select other boot modes -> kms (for better screen resolution)
- Configure keyboard if needed
- X window automatic
- On Deskop, double click on clonezilla server
- For eth1 select static ip : 192.168.10.1
- If the image is on the local hard disk or usb disc, use localdev to mount
  - Mount the system (on server salafis sda7 is /home)
  - Select the parent directory of the directory containing the
    images (in this case it will be /home/oquendo)
    The more recent image is called 2017-01-26-01-img-client
- Select *advanced mode*
- select *restore-disk*
- Use default options
- *Select -k1 to create partition table proportionally*
- Yes to check the image before restoring
- Skip option of always provide clonezilla server
- Choose image to clone (should be detected automatically)
- Choose sda (target disk to be written on each client)
- Choose multicast or *unicast* retore (some switches block
  multicast so you can try *unicast*). Multicast is great since all
  computers will update at the same time. Advice: give at least 8
  minutes to clonezilla to wait for all clients to start.
- Choose time clients+time-t-wait or whatever (100 clients, 300 secs)
- Here clonezilla starts to check the image
- Boot clients using net PXE
DONE

** lite server
- Boot the same clonezilla live iso
- When booting, choose alternative modes to have better resolution.
- Choose the language
- Start clonezilla
- Select lite-server
- start start lite-server
- netboot (or both)
- auto-detect or use-existing-dhcpd
- select localdev or ssh server or ...
- nofsck (to skip) or check if you are having problems
- Select the correct dir with the image
- Begginer / expert
- Massive deployment
- From image
- restore disk
- Select the image (should be detected)
- Select the partition
- Yes check the image
- reboot
- Select the mode: multicast, broadcast, bittorrent
- Select the number of clients to wait, the time, or boot
- Here clonezilla checks the image and then starts to wait
- Boot clients using pxe
