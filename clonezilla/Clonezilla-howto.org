* Cloning a device into an image
  Based on Clonezilla live (not the server)
  - When booting, choose alternative modes to have better resolution.
  - Choose the language
  - Start clonezilla
  - select device-image
  - To save, use local_dev (or the appropriate)
  - Select the parent dir where to save the image
  - choose beginner
  - Use savedisk to save local disk to image
  - use the default name or modify it
  - choose the disk to clone
  - skip checking (but better check if you are getting errors when
    creating the image)
    - select check the saved image
  - Do not encrypt
  - choose reboot if you want
  DONE

* Cloning an image to several computers using clonezilla server
  - Burn drbl-server live on a usb
  - Boot the computer-server from the usb
  - Select other boot modes -> kms (for better screen resolution)
  - Configure keyboard if needed
  - X window automatic
  - On Deskop, double click on clonezilla server
  - For eth1 select static ip : 192.168.10.1
  - If the image is on the local hard disk or usb disc, use localdev to mount 
    - Mount the system (on server salafis sda7 is /home)
    - Select the parent directory of the directory containing the
      images (in this case it will be /home/oquendo)
      The more recent image is called 2017-01-26-01-img-client
  - Select *advanced mode*
  - select *restore-disk*
  - Use default options
  - *Select -k1 to create partition table proportionally*
  - Yes to check the image before restoring 
  - Skip option of always provide clonezilla server
  - Choose image to clone (should be detected automatically)
  - Choose sda (target disk to be written on each client)
  - Choose multicast or *unicast* retore (some switches block
    multicast so you can try *unicast*). Multicast is great since all
    computers will update at the same time. Advice: give at least 8
    minutes to clonezilla to wait for all clients to start.
  - Choose time clients+time-t-wait or whatever (100 clients, 300 secs)
  - Here clonezilla starts to check the image
  - Boot clients using net PXE
  DONE
